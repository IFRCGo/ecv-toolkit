  <li>Animals such as cattle, poultry (birds), rats and pigs can carry and spread germs that cause diseases.</li>
  <li>Animals can carry germs in their bodies when they are alive and in their meat when they are slaughtered for food. Animal by-products, such as milk or eggs, can also carry germs.</li>
  <li>Animals that have died (including foetuses that aborted or animals that died during birth) can also carry germs.</li>
  <li>To avoid spreading diseases, it is important to wear personal protective equipment and follow recommended hygiene practices when dealing with live or dead animals and their by-products.</li>
