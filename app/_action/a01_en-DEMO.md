## Overview

- Community-based surveillance is an active process of community participation in detecting, reporting, responding to and monitoring health events in the community. 
- Information discovered while doing surveillance should be given to the local branch and health authorities that can help.
- Detecting an outbreak early through community based surveillance is extremely important in controlling outbreaks and saves lives.

## What volunteers can do

- Map the community (see Action Tool 2).
- Identify who may be vulnerable to the disease in the community.
- Know the disease that may happen in your community, be sure to know the signs and symptoms.
- Divide up into surveillance teams who will actively look for sick people in their sections of the community.
- When people who are sick with the disease are detected, assess how severely ill they are and whether they need to be referred to a health facility (see Action Tool 4).
- If sick people can be cared for at home, show their families how to do it and provide them with information and supplies, where possible (see Action Tool 3).
- Record the cases you find and put all the records together with those of other teams so that you can build a clear picture of how the disease is spreading in the community.
