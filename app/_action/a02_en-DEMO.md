## Overview

- A map of the community is useful because it allows you to connect issues or problems with particular places and make them visual. 
- It is a good idea to make the map together with community members. 
- Community mapping is a very good tool in epidemics because it helps guide your work to where the biggest problems or needs are as well as help identify risks. It can be used to support preparedness and planning before an epidemic occurs.

Draw a simple spatial map that shows the community with all its key reference points. You should try to include: 

- the whole community, concentrations of people, their houses and who lives where;
- the main points in the community (school, health centre, places of worship, water sources, markets etc.);
- the location of vulnerable people most at risk;
- if possible, where the epidemic started and how it is spreading;
- health hazards and risks.

Use the map to mark new cases or referred cases. Make teams to cover certain areas of the map. Each team should find out what it can about its area (how many people are sick, who is vulnerable, how many have been referred to health authorities and any other relevant information). 

When you combine maps from different teams, you will be able to see the areas you are covering and all of the details for each area. This will help you plan your actions. 

Maps are in many cases easier to understand than lots of words.
