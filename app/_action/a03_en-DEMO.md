## Overview

- Clear communication that the community trusts is very important during a disease outbreak. 
- Providing information to communities to improve their knowledge is just the first step. The most important part is getting people to change behaviour to safer, less risky practices that will stop a disease spreading. These behaviours can be getting vaccinated, washing hands with soap, wearing mosquito repellent or agreeing to be isolated (separated) form others while they are sick. 
- Communication in an epidemic can be difficult because people may not trust authorities or the health system, so they may not listen or believe the information given. Some communities have strong beliefs in traditional medicine, or don't accept treatments (including medicines and vaccines) or other methods of preventing disease. Disease outbreaks can cause a lot of fear in communities, and people may be grieving if many are sick or have died. 
- Two-way communication is important in an epidemic. Put the community at the centre and work together with them to choose appropriate solutions that are effective in stopping the spread of disease. 

## How to communicate in an epidemic
 
Instead of just giving the community information (one-way communication), use two-way communication in an epidemic. This means that you ask the community and then listen to what they have to say. 

Engage with community members and community leaders, and work together with them to choose and plan appropriate solutions for stopping the spread of disease. 

Have a conversation with the community about their understanding, ideas and fears about the disease and its transmission, as well as things that motivate them and stop them from changing behaviour.

When you communicate with communities, it is important to always listen for any rumours or misunderstandings that might be spreading. Rumours can cause a lot of panic and fear, and can mean that communities lose trust in health authorities or their ability to stop the epidemic and can reject interventions to prevent the spread of disease.  

To make sure it is effective in mobilising the community, communication needs to be:

- Simple and short - so people can easily understand it and so messages can be repeated frequently and easily. 
- Delivered by people or through a channel that the community trusts.
- Give correct, specific information or advice - it is important not to confuse the community. 
- Guiding the community in what to do, rather than giving lots of information with no actions to take. 
- Possible and realistic - so that people can actually do what is in the message. 
- Specific and adapted for that community - it is very important to include social and cultural factors that might support or stop community members from changing to safer behaviours, or might help them to accept treatments (including vaccinations). 

## Ways of communicating 

When communicating with your community, it is important to use different forms and methods of communication depending on what people prefer and trust, what the message is, who the target group is, and what resources you have. 

Some different ways to communicate are:

- Door-to-door visits 
- Meeting with community or religious leaders, or traditional healers or midwives
- Group discussions - can use visual tools like picture cards 
- Participatory activities such as 3 pile sorting, voting charts, mapping, barrier analysis and planning 
- Video/movies/cinema
- Songs, poems, drama, role-play or theatre 
- Visual methods (picture cards) 
- Community announcements (e.g. loud-speaker) 
- SMS or social media 
- Radio broadcast 

## What volunteers can do

Have a two-way conversations with communities (ask and listen) and work together with them to choose appropriate solutions for them that are effective in stopping the spread of disease. 

Understand where the community gets their health information from, and who they trust to give them this information (e.g. health authorities, community leader, doctors, traditional healers, religious leaders etc.) 

Understand your community's fears, ideas or knowledge about the disease, understanding of how the disease is spread (transmitted), normal cultural and social practices, as well as things that motivate them or stop them from changing behaviour.

Keep in mind that communities are made up of many different people and groups. Make sure you include everyone in the community, especially those who are hidden, stigmatized or 'different' because of their religion, sexual orientation, age, disability or illness, or any other reason. 

Listen for rumours or incorrect information that people in the community are talking about. Make a note of when and where the rumour was heard, and report this to your volunteer supervisor or National Society focal point immediately. Give the community clear, simple facts about the disease and let them know things they can do to protect themselves and their families from disease.
