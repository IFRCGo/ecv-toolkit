## Overview

- In many cases of sickness in an epidemic, the person cannot be treated at home or by volunteers or family. They will need specialized medical care and will have to go to a health clinic or a hospital.

## What you need to know

- Know how to tell when someone is severely sick with the disease. Know the symptoms and guidelines for action.
- Know where the health facilities close to your community are, and know which ones to use in case of serious disease (their 'capacity'). Know how to get to them. Do they have any ambulances? Can they be reached by public transport? 
- Talk to health professionals and agree with them on an appropriate means to send sick people from the community to the health facilities. If the disease is highly infectious (e.g. Ebola or Marburg), special transport must be arranged so that other people are not infected.
- When doing disease surveillance, always keep the idea of referral in mind.

## What volunteers can do

- Learn the symptoms of the disease causing the epidemic and when they need referral to health facilities.
- Visit health facilities and talk to doctors and nurses, tell them about your activities and how you plan to do the referrals. Take advice from them. 
- Decide on what methods are available for referral. Are there ambulances? Know how to call them. Is there public transport? Can the National Society provide transport? Do people have money to pay for transport?
- Always carry the relevant disease tool with you when you are doing surveillance so you can remember the information about the disease and its symptoms.
- Always explain clearly to the family what the disease is, what the symptoms are and why you think referral is needed. Give them information about the health facilities available and what means of transportation are possible.
