## Overview

- Early access to Oral Rehydration Solution (ORS) saves lives.
- When a cholera epidemic (or large numbers of people needing rehydration such as during displacement) occur, the National Society should establish community oral rehydration points (ORP).
- ORP provide rehydration solution quickly, but also ensure screening and referral of sick people and can act as a central location for information. 

## What are ORP  

The ORP is the first level in the treatment of cholera and should be utilized to improve access to ORS at the community level. It is extremely important in areas where access to health facilities is difficult or where the high number of cases is overwhelming the health services. The ORP as the first level of care should be planed as part of a comprehensive clinical pathway that includes Cholera Treatment Units (CTU's) and Cholera treatment centres (CTC).

## Key points to remember when looking after a community ORP (for volunteers)

- Use only boiled or purified water. If the water is unsafe, start by treating it with water purification tablets (1 tablet for each 10 litres of water).
- Do not put more ORS in the boiled or purified water than is recommended.
- Keep the buckets covered to protect the mixture against contamination by flies, etc.
- If you still have some ORS mixture left at the end of the day, GET RID OF IT!
- Distribute ORS to patients but also arrange referrals or visits to the patients by a health professional. This should be done urgently if the person shows any evidence of dehydration.
- Use the latex gloves provided when you are in contact with patients, their stools or vomit.
- Use the household gloves when you are in contact with phenols or cresols, i.e. when using Kohrsolin (a concentrated disinfectant). ( see action tool 39)
- Kohrsolin is ONLY to be used as a disinfectant, in diluted form, to disinfect floors, buckets, surgical instruments, linens, etc. It must NOT be used to sterilize water. For more information on preparing and using other disinfectants see Action Tool 39. 
- Remember: Wash your hands regularly! Early and prompt treatment can prevent death from cholera in most cases! Use a clean latrine! Make sure drinking water is treated and free from germs!
