**Note:**  Handwashing  (gloved  hands)  should  be  performed  before  starting  removing  the  protective    clothing,  between  the  steps  and  at  the  end  for  ungloved hands.
**Note:** Different PPE types are used in different contexts affecting the operating procedures.  Always ensure that you have been properly trained to use the type of PPE available in your context.
