### Overview

- Patients with diarrhoea, especially children, can lose a lot of fluid from their bodies and suffer dehydration. 
- Dehydration can cause very severe illness and sometimes death, especially in association with acute watery diarrhoea and cholera.

### How to assess whether a patient has dehydration, and its extent:


| Dehydration stage |	Signs |	Treatment
| --- | --- | ---
| No dehydration | Skin recovers its shape normally when pinched; thirst has subsided; urine has been passed; the pulse is strong. | Oral rehydration solution (ORS) at home; zinc supplements for children up to 15 years of age.
| Moderate dehydration | Restlessness and irritability; sunken eyes, dry mouth and tongue, increased thirst; skin recovers its normal shape slowly when pinched; reduced urine; decreased tears; depressed fontanels in infants.| ORS and very close surveillance; zinc supplements for children up to 15 years of age.
| Severe dehydration | Lethargy or unconsciousness; very dry mouth and tongue; skin recovers shape very slowly when pinched (’tenting’); weak or absent pulse; low blood pressure; minimal or no urine. | In a health facility or in a hospital:
IV therapy plus antibiotics plus ORS; zinc supplements for children up to 15 years of age.

### After the assessment, and according to the degree of dehydration, the following actions should be taken:

| Deydration stage | Action|
| --- | --- |
| No dehydration | Give ORS and zinc. Action tools 9, 10 and 11 |   
| Moderate dehydration | Give ORS and zinc. Action tools 9, 10 and 11 |   
| Severe dehydration | Refer immediately to health facility or hospital |
