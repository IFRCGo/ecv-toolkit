title: Community oral rehydration points
lang: en
---

### Overview

- Early access to oral rehydration solution (ORS) saves lives.
- When a cholera epidemic occurs (or large numbers of people need rehydration, for example after displacement), the National Society should set up community oral rehydration points (ORP).
- ORPs provide rehydration solution quickly, provide screening and referral for sick people, and can act as a central information hub.

### What are ORPs?  

An ORP provides the first level of treatment of cholera and improves access to ORS at community level. ORPs are extremely important in areas where access to health facilities is difficult or where the high number of cases is overwhelming health services. As the first level of care, ORPs should be planned elements of a comprehensive clinical pathway that includes cholera treatment units (CTUs) and cholera treatment centres (CTCs).

### Key points for volunteers to remember if they look after a community ORP

- Use only boiled or purified water. If the water is unsafe, treat it first with water purification tablets (1 tablet for every 10 litres of water).
-	Do not put more ORS than recommended in boiled or purified water.
-	Keep buckets covered to protect the mixture against contamination by flies, etc.
-	If you still have some ORS mixture left at the end of the day, DISPOSE OF IT SAFELY!
-	Distribute ORS to patients but also arrange referrals or visits to the patients by a health professional. This should be done urgently if the person shows any evidence of dehydration.
-	Use the latex gloves provided when you are in contact with patients, their stools or vomit.
-	Use household gloves when you are in contact with phenols or cresols (in other words, when you use Kohrsolin, a concentrated disinfectant). (See Action Tool 39.)
-	Kohrsolin is ONLY to be used as a disinfectant, in diluted form, to disinfect floors, buckets, surgical instruments, linens, etc. It must NOT be used to sterilize water. For more information on preparing and using other disinfectants, see Action Tool 39. 
-	Remember: *Wash your hands regularly! Early and prompt treatment can prevent death from cholera in most cases! Use a clean latrine! Make sure drinking water is treated and free from germs!* 

### ORPs

1.	Initiate early treatment of mild and moderate cases of dehydration by distributing ORS and zinc when appropriate. (See Activity Tool 10<a class="crosslink" href="{% render_depth %}{% render_link action|10 %}"><i class="fas fa-external-link-alt" aria-hidden="true"></i></a>)
2.	Distribute key commodities, such as ORS, soap, and household water treatment supplies. (See Action Tool 9<a class="crosslink" href="{% render_depth %}{% render_link action|10 %}"><i class="fas fa-external-link-alt" aria-hidden="true"></i></a>)
3.	Refer severe or at risk cases to health facilities for treatment. (See Action Tool 4<a class="crosslink" href="{% render_depth %}{% render_link action|4 %}"><i class="fas fa-external-link-alt" aria-hidden="true"></i></a>)
4.	Act as a community-based disease surveillance point, ensuring that all suspected cases are recorded. (See Action Tool 1<a class="crosslink" href="{% render_depth %}{% render_link action|1 %}"><i class="fas fa-external-link-alt" aria-hidden="true"></i></a>)
5.	Are a key reference point for behaviour-change and social mobilization activities. (See Action Tool 43.)
6.	Distribute zinc supplements (if approved). (See Action Tool 12<a class="crosslink" href="{% render_depth %}{% render_link action|12 %}"><i class="fas fa-external-link-alt" aria-hidden="true"></i></a>)
