### Overview

- Vitamin A is vital for a child’s healthy development. 
- Vitamin A is usually provided by foods such as liver, dairy products and eggs. 
- Sometimes, children do not have enough vitamin A in their diet and are at risk of becoming very sick if they have measles, malaria or diarrhoea. 
- Lack of vitamin A can also cause eye problems and even blindness.

### How to give vitamin A supplements

- Vitamin A can be given to children in the form of a liquid or capsules. 
- During a mass measles vaccination campaign, vitamin A supplements should be given to ALL CHILDREN BETWEEN 6 MONTHS AND 5 YEARS OF AGE.

### What you can do

- Make sure you know your National Society’s policy on when volunteers may give vitamin A to children. Follow the policy.
-	Conduct social mobilization activities before a vaccination campaign (see Action Tool 25<a class="crosslink" href="{% render_depth %}{% render_link action|25 %}"><i class="fas fa-external-link-alt" aria-hidden="true"></i></a>) to tell the community about vitamin A supplementation.
-	Coordinate with health professionals from your local health facilities. They can tell you how to administer vitamin A and what doses to give.
- Make sure a good plan is prepared for providing vitamin A supplements.
-	Make sure all children from the ages of 6 months to 5 years are given vitamin A correctly.
-	Register all children to whom you administer vitamin A and make sure that you do not give a child two doses.
