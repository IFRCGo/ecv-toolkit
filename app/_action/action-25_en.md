### Overview

- A mass vaccination campaign occurs when the authorities give vaccinations to as many (appropriate) people as possible in a short period.
- Mass vaccinations take place in addition to routine vaccinations (see Action tool 24<a class="crosslink" href="{% render_depth %}{% render_link action|24 %}"><i class="fas fa-external-link-alt" aria-hidden="true"></i></a>). They may be organized because routine vaccinations cannot be given or in order to help control an epidemic.
- Mass vaccinations are even more important in some kinds of epidemic because they help to protect vulnerable children.
