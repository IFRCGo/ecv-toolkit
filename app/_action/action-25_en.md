### Overview

- A mass vaccination campaign occurs when the authorities give vaccinations to as many (appropriate) people as possible in a short period.
- Mass vaccinations take place in addition to routine vaccinations (see Action Tool 24). They may be organized because routine vaccinations cannot be given or in order to help control an epidemic. 
- Mass vaccinations are even more important in some kinds of epidemic because they help to protect vulnerable children.

### Volunteers

Normally, volunteers do not administer vaccines directly to children, but you can help in many other ways.

-	The most important task is SOCIAL MOBILIZATION (see Action Tool 43). 
-	Coordinate with the health authorities.
-	Use the National Societyâ€™s network to publicise mass vaccination campaigns. Help logistically to organize them.
