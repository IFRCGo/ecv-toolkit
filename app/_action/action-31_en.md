### Overview

- Food can carry or breed germs that spread disease and make people sick. 
- Germs in food that is not clean or is not covered can help spread diarrhoeal diseases (including cholera) and other diseases such as hepatitis, typhoid and anthrax.

### What you need to know

- Food that is not clean, covered and thoroughly cooked can contain germs that cause people to fall sick.
- People in the community may not know or understand how food can be contaminated or how a disease can spread through food. It is important to explain the importance of good food hygiene so that people can protect themselves and their families from becoming sick.

### Food hygiene
