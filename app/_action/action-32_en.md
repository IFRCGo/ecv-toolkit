### Overview

- Good sanitation is vital to stop the spread of many epidemics, such as diarrhoea <a class="crosslink" href="{% render_depth %}{% render_link disease|1 %}"><i class="fas fa-external-link-alt" aria-hidden="true"></i></a> and cholera <a class="crosslink" href="{% render_depth %}{% render_link disease|2 %}"><i class="fas fa-external-link-alt" aria-hidden="true"></i></a>. 
- As volunteers, you can encourage members of the community to improve their sanitation by using latrines, disposing of rubbish and removing standing water.

### These are the most important sanitation initiatives for preventing disease

- Dispose of excreta (faeces) safely (by constructing latrines).
-	Dispose of solid waste and rubbish safely.
-	Bury corpses and destroy animal carcasses safely.
-	Control disease vectors and protect people from them.
-	Incinerate medical waste.
-	Drain or remove waste water and standing water. (Camps should be designed with this in mind.)
-	Promote hygiene and teach people how to keep themselves safe and clean.
