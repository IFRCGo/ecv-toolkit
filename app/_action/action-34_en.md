### Overview

- Washing your hands is one of the most important ways to prevent the spread of many epidemics, especially diarrhoeal diseases.

### How to wash hands

- Wet your hands and rub them with soap or ash.

- Use lots of force (push your hands together hard) and remember to wash all surfaces, including the backs of the hands and between the fingers.
- Rinse hands well so they are free of soap or ash.
