### Overview

- If you are not extremely careful, you are likely to fall sick in certain epidemics when you try to help people. (See Action Tool 5 <a class="crosslink" href="{% render_depth %}{% render_link action|5 %}"><i class="fas fa-external-link-alt" aria-hidden="true"></i></a> and Action Tool 6 <a class="crosslink" href="{% render_depth %}{% render_link action|6 %}"><i class="fas fa-external-link-alt" aria-hidden="true"></i></a> on volunteer protection and using PPE.)
- Handwashing is a vital source of protection when you deal with Ebola, Marburg fever, Lassa fever, plague, MERS and monkeypox.

### Why is handwashing important and why is handwashing different in epidemics?

- Highly infectious germs are spread very easily through body fluids and certain diseases can even be transmitted via the bodies of people who are dead.
- Very vigorous and comprehensive handwashing is needed in such cases.
- When working in such epidemics, it is critical to use all available forms of protection. (See Action Tool 5 <a class="crosslink" href="{% render_depth %}{% render_link action|5 %}"><i class="fas fa-external-link-alt" aria-hidden="true"></i></a> and Action Tool 6 <a class="crosslink" href="{% render_depth %}{% render_link action|6 %}"><i class="fas fa-external-link-alt" aria-hidden="true"></i></a> on volunteer protection and using personal protection equipment.)
- When you wash your hands during an epidemic, to eliminate all the germs on your hands you need to:
    - Use soap or an alcohol-based disinfectant.
    - Wash your hands as usual.
    - Then wash thoroughly between your fingers.
    - Scrub the tips of the fingers of the two hands together.
    - Wash each of your thumbs with the other hand.
    - Scrub the tips of the fingers of each hand on the palm of the other hand.
- During an epidemic (of a highly infectious disease, or another disease such as diarrhoea or cholera, or a respiratory infection), it is a good idea to use this handwashing method every time you have touched something that can pass on an infection.
