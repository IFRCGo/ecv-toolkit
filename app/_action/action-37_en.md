### Overview

- Mosquito nets help significantly to prevent diseases, such as malaria, that are spread by mosquitoes.

### What you need to know

- Mosquito nets are one of the most important ways to protect against malaria and other diseases spread by mosquitoes.
-	The most effective nets (LLINs) are treated with long-lasting insecticide (which kills mosquitoes).
-	These nets are effective for three to five years.
-	To be effective, nets must be used properly.

### How to use long-lasting insecticide-treated mosquito nets (LLINs) properly

- Hang the net above the sleeping space.
-	Make sure the net is tucked under the mattress or mat to prevent mosquitoes from getting inside.
-	Keep the net closed while sleeping and during the day while you are away from the sleeping place.
-	Washing the net can remove insecticide. When you wash the net, follow the washing instructions provided with the net. Do not wash the net too often.
-	Repair any rips or tears in the net.
-	Replace the nets at regular intervals, as advised (every three-five years).
