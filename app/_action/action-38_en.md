### Overview

- Rubbish can attract rodents and create a breeding area for flies and mosquitoes.
- Animal faeces near houses and in the village increase the number of flies and insects that carry germs, cause diseases, and contaminate water sources.
- Animal faeces around houses and in the village attract and multiply the flies and insects that carry germs, cause diseases and contaminate water sources.
- Mosquitoes (which carry malaria <a class="crosslink" href="{% render_depth %}{% render_link disease|14 %}"><i class="fas fa-external-link-alt" aria-hidden="true"></i></a>, dengue fever <a class="crosslink" href="{% render_depth %}{% render_link disease|13 %}"><i class="fas fa-external-link-alt" aria-hidden="true"></i></a>, chikungunya <a class="crosslink" href="{% render_depth %}{% render_link disease|12 %}"><i class="fas fa-external-link-alt" aria-hidden="true"></i></a>, Zika <a class="crosslink" href="{% render_depth %}{% render_link disease|15 %}"><i class="fas fa-external-link-alt" aria-hidden="true"></i></a> and yellow fever <a class="crosslink" href="{% render_depth %}{% render_link disease|11 %}"><i class="fas fa-external-link-alt" aria-hidden="true"></i></a>) breed in standing water.
- Rubbish should be burned or buried.
- Vegetation should be cleared from river banks and ponds near the village.
- The area around water sources (pumps, wells) should be kept clean.

Tell community members how important it is to keep their community clean. Organize regular clean-up campaigns. Include houses and latrines, etc.


### What you can do

- Work with traditional and political leaders, the village health committee and other community partners to decide what needs to be cleaned up and how to go about it.
-	Help to organize activities on agreed "clean-up" days.
-	Ask community leaders to organize volunteer groups for each clean-up initiative.
-	Organize special clean-up days in which all members of the community participate (twice a year or more often if possible).
-	Organize a community initiative to plan and create a central garbage disposal area.

Motivate and support the community to work together to:
-	Keep the community free of animal faeces.
-	Keep the community free of puddles and other mosquito breeding sites.
- Keep the community free of rubbish and garbage (by burning or burying it).
- Clean the areas around water sources (such as pumps and wells).
- Create and maintain water soak pits around water sources.

Make sure to dispose of waste properly. This will help to protect the community from germs.
