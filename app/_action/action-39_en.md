### Overview

- Disinfectant is a solution that can be used to kill germs on surfaces, bedding, clothing and dead bodies. 
- It is especially useful in epidemics to kill the germs that are causing the epidemic.
- Many different ingredients can be added to water to create disinfectants. 
- Making disinfectants can be dangerous because it involves mixing chemicals with water. Always follow the instructions and use the help of trained people to make disinfectants. 
- Look at the cholera kit (see Action Tool 6 <a class="crosslink" href="{% render_depth %}{% render_link action|6 %}"><i class="fas fa-external-link-alt" aria-hidden="true"></i></a>) for more information on the preparation and use of disinfectants.

### Disinfectants are especially useful in the following cases:

- In cholera and acute watery diarrhoea epidemics, they can be used to disinfect beds and surfaces that have been in contact with vomit or diarrhoea. Disinfectants should also be used to disinfect the bodies, before their burial, of people who die from cholera in the community or a clinic. 
-	In Ebola, Marburg fever, Lassa Fever, plague, MERS and moneypox outbreaks, because these diseases can spread as a result of almost any contact with the sick person, disinfectants are vital for cleaning surfaces and other objects that a sick person may have touched, and for cleaning dead bodies. Other items used by a sick person, such as clothing and sheets, should be burned, where possible in an incinerator. (See Action Tool 40 <a class="crosslink" href="{% render_depth %}{% render_link action|40 %}"><i class="fas fa-external-link-alt" aria-hidden="true"></i></a>)
-	Disinfectants keep health facilities such as clinics and hospitals clean and reduce the spread of disease among patients. Remember to clean the latrines as well. 
-	Chlorine can also be used to treat water for drinking and other purposes. This can only be done by volunteers who are trained and under the supervision of a water and sanitation specialist.

### Preparation of different strengths of chlorine solution

### Use of disinfectants
-	Always take care when using disinfectants because they are dangerous. Always wear gloves, a face mask and goggles, and an apron or overalls to protect your clothes. 
-	When specialists are available, always follow their advice on preparing, handling and using disinfectants. 
-	Do not touch 1:10 disinfectant with your hands or let it touch your bare skin. **Always use thick gloves for protection.**
-	Disinfectants are available as part of the cholera kit (see Action Tool 7 <a class="crosslink" href="{% render_depth %}{% render_link action|7 %}"><i class="fas fa-external-link-alt" aria-hidden="true"></i></a>).
