### Overview

- It some cultures it is acceptable to spit.
- Spitting contains saliva which can transmit diseases that are carried in droplets or in air.

### Why learn spitting etiquette?

- Some diseases can be transmitted from one person to another in droplets of saliva or mucous or in the air.
- This means that, when we spit, we can spread diseases that we have to other people and make them sick.
- During an outbreak where droplets of saliva can spread the disease people should be encouraged to stop spitting altogether or spit into a tissue and dispose correctly.

### DOs and DON'Ts

- Many people spit onto the ground and this is not good practice as sometimes they may wipe their mouth with their hand. This is NOT good practice because, afterwards, you can still transmit germs by touching things or shaking the hands of other people.
- The best option during an outbreak is to stop spitting onto the ground, spit into a tissue and then dispose of correctly into a waste container with a lid on it followed by washing your hands with soap and water.

### What you can do

- Explain reasons why it is better to stop the practice of spitting during an outbreak people in your community.
- Explain that stopping spitting matters because it helps to prevent the transmission of diseases that are spread through droplets carried in the air.
- Show people how to spit properly and ask them to teach the same behaviour to others.
- When talking about spitting etiquette, also teach people about proper hygiene (see Action tool 28<a class="crosslink" href="{% render_depth %}{% render_link action|28 %}"><i class="fas fa-external-link-alt" aria-hidden="true"></i></a> and 34<a class="crosslink" href="{% render_depth %}{% render_link action|34 %}"><i class="fas fa-external-link-alt" aria-hidden="true"></i></a>).
- Make posters that show the DOs and DONâ€™Ts of spitting etiquette and put them up around your community. (See Action tool 43<a class="crosslink" href="{% render_depth %}{% render_link action|43 %}"><i class="fas fa-external-link-alt" aria-hidden="true"></i></a> for more information on social mobilization techniques).
