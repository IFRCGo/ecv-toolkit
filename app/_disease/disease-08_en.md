Measles is a very contagious virus that can make children very sick. In a community where no one is vaccinated, one person with measles can infect between 12 and 18 other people.

### Transmission

- Coughing, sneezing or close personal contact (infected droplets in the air are breathed in by another person)
- Direct contact with infected nose or throat mucous

### Symptoms

- Can start with high fever, runny nose, cold, cough, red and watery eyes and sometimes white spots inside the mouth.
- After a few days, a flat red blotchy rash appears, usually starting on the head, face and upper neck, and continues to spreads to the rest of the body.
- In severe cases, measles can cause blindness, encephalitis (an infection that causes brain swelling), severe diarrhoea and dehydration, ear infections, or severe respiratory infections such as pneumonia.

### Prevention

- Routine vaccination of children
- Mass vaccination campaigns with social mobilization in countries where the disease is common and causes many deaths
- Rapid detection and referral of suspected cases to health facilities
- Reduced overcrowding in shelters
- Improved ventilation in shelters
- Separation of people sick with measles for four days after they develop a rash
- Coughing etiquette (cough into sleeve, handkerchief or tissue, NOT the hand)
- Handwashing with soap
- Social mobilization and behaviour change communication

### Vulnerable people

- Children who are not vaccinated, especially those who are poorly nourished or have vitamin A deficiency
- Adults aged more than 20 years old
- Pregnant women
- Displaced populations and those living in cramped or crowded conditions
- People whose immune systems are compromised (for example, by leukaemia or HIV infection)

### If an epidemic occurs

- Rapidly detect and refer suspected cases to health facilities.
- Support mass vaccination campaigns and social mobilization for them.
- Provide vitamin A supplements for children with measles who are between 6 months and five years of age.
- Isolate people sick with measles for four days after they develop a rash.
- Promote handwashing with soap.
-	Reduce overcrowding in shelters.
- Improve ventilation in shelters.
- Promote coughing etiquette (cough into sleeve, handkerchief or tissue, NOT the hand).
- Increase social mobilization and behaviour change communication.
-	Monitor for malnutrition.

### Community-based assessment - questions

Make a map of the community and mark the information you gather on the map. Record other details.
- When did people start to fall sick with measles?
- How many people have fallen sick with measles? Where?
- How many people have died? Where?
- How many people live in the affected community or area? How many children under five years of age live in the area?
- Who and where are the vulnerable people?
- Are children under five most affected? Or are other age groups, occupations, etc., more affected?
- Are children in the affected community generally well nourished?
-	Do people always have enough food?
- How common is breastfeeding?
- Are children in the affected community vaccinated for measles or not?
- Is a vaccination campaign planned?
- Do strong cultural beliefs or perceptions about vaccination prevent children from being vaccinated?
- Where are the local health facilities and services? (Include traditional and community carers.)
- What are the communityâ€™s habits, practices and beliefs about caring for and feeding sick people? When babies and infants are sick, do women continue to breastfeed them?
- Is a social mobilization or health promotion programme in place?
- Which sources of information do people use most?
- Are rumours or is misinformation about the disease spreading in the community?
