### Transmission

- Mosquito bite
- Mosquitoes that spread yellow fever bite during the day

### Symptoms

- Most people who are infected with yellow fever do not get sick or have only a mild illness.
- Starts with sudden fever, headache and backache, muscle pain, nausea, vomiting and tiredness.
- The sick person may get better for a short time but can get worse and develop jaundice (yellow skin or eyes).
- Sick persons may also bleed from the gums, nose or eyes, vomit blood, or have blood in their stools.

### Prevention

- Routine vaccination
- Prevention of mosquito bites by putting insect screens on windows and doors and personal protection (application of repellents, long sleeved clothes, etc.)
- Community clean up campaigns to remove rubbish and cover water containers
- Elimination of mosquito breeding sites by removing standing water, fogging, and applying larvicides
- Social mobilization and behaviour change communication

### Vulnerable people

- Every person in the community who is not vaccinated can get yellow fever
- Young children and older people are more likely to become very sick or have complications

### If an epidemic occurs

- Support mass vaccination campaigns
- Increase community-based surveillance
- Rapidly detect and refer suspected cases to health facilities
- Increase social mobilization and behaviour change communication
- Promote community clean up campaigns to remove rubbish and cover water containers.
- Encourage prevention of mosquito bites by placing insect screens on windows and doors and wearing personal protection (apply repellents, wear long sleeved clothes, etc.)
- Eliminate mosquito breeding sites by removing standing water, fogging, and applying larvicides
- Encourage young children and people who sleep during the day to sleep under a mosquito net (if windows and doors are not screened)

### Community-based assessment - questions

Make a map of the community and mark the information you gather on the map. Record other details.
- When did people start to fall sick with yellow fever?
- How many people have fallen sick with yellow fever? Where?
- How many people have died? Where?
-	How many people live in the affected community or area? How many children under five years of age live in the area?
- Who and where are the vulnerable people?
- Are children under five most affected? Or are other age groups, occupations, etc., more affected?
- Are children and adults in the affected community vaccinated against yellow fever?
- Is a vaccination campaign planned?
- Do strong cultural beliefs or perceptions about vaccination prevent children from being vaccinated?
- Do people usually cover their water containers (inside and outside)?
