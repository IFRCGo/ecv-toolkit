### Transmission

- Mosquito bite. 
- Mosquitoes that spread chikungunya usually bite during the day, especially in early morning and late afternoon or evening. 
- In rare cases, transmission is from mother to new-born baby around the time of birth. 

### Symptoms

- Sudden fever, often with joint pain. 
- Other symptoms include headache, nausea, tiredness and rash. 
- Joint pain is often severe. 
- It lasts for several days, but may last much longer. 
- Most people with chikungunya get better and return to normal, but sometimes joint pain continues for months or even years. 
- In older people, chikungunya can contribute to the cause of death.

### Prevention

- Prevention of mosquito bites by placing insect screens on windows and doors and personal protection (application of repellents, wearing long sleeved clothes, etc.). 
- Community clean up campaigns to remove rubbish and cover water containers. 
- Elimination of mosquito breeding sites by removing standing water, fogging, and applying larvicides.
- Social mobilization and behaviour change communication. 

### Vulnerable people

- Older people. 
- People with medical conditions (high blood pressure, diabetes, heart disease). 
- New-born babies infected around the time of birth. 

### If an epidemic occurs

- Increase community-based surveillance. 
- Rapidly detect and refer serious cases to health facilities.
- Increase social mobilization and behaviour change communication.
- Promote community clean up campaigns to remove rubbish and cover water containers. 
- Encourage prevention of mosquito bites by placing insect screens on windows and doors and wearing personal protection (apply repellents, wear long sleeved clothes, etc.). 
- Eliminate mosquito breeding sites by removing standing water, fogging, and applying larvicides.
- Encourage young children and people who sleep during the day to sleep under a mosquito net (if windows and doors are not screened). 

### Community-based assessment - questions

Make a map of the community and mark the information you gather on the map. Record other details.
- When did people start to fall sick with chikungunya? 
- How many people have fallen sick with chikungunya? Where? 
-	How many people have died? Where? 
- How many people live in the affected community or area? How many children under 5 years of age live in the area? 
- Who and where are the vulnerable people? 
- Are children under 5 most affected? Or are other age groups, occupations, etc., more affected?
- Do people usually cover their water containers (inside and outside)? 
- How many houses have insect screens on the windows and doors? 
- What are the community’s habits, practices and beliefs regarding use of repellents, sprays, etc.? 
- How does the community usually dispose of rubbish and solid waste? 
- Have the authorities established a vector control programme?
- Where are the local health facilities and services? (Include traditional and community carers.) 
- What are the community’s habits, practices and beliefs about caring for and feeding sick people? Do women continue to breastfeed babies and infants when they are sick?
- Is a social mobilization or health promotion programme in place? 
- Which sources of information do people use most? 
- Are rumours or is misinformation about the disease spreading in the community?
