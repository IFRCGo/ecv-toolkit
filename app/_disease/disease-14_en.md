### Transmission

- Mosquito bite. 
- Mosquitoes that spread Zika virus usually bite during the day, especially in early morning and late afternoon or evening. 
- During pregnancy the disease can pass from a mother to her unborn baby. 
- Unprotected sex. 

### Symptoms

- Many people infected with Zika virus have no symptoms or have only mild symptoms. 
- Mild fever, skin rash, red eyes, muscle and joint pain, headache or feeling unwell. 
- Getting Zika during pregnancy can cause serious brain defects in the unborn baby. 
- Zika may cause a severe illness called Guillain-Barré syndrome, which causes sudden muscle weakness and can sometimes be life-threatening.

### Prevention

- Prevention of mosquito bites by placing insect screens on windows and doors and personal protection (application of repellents, wearing long sleeved clothes, etc.). 
- Community clean up campaigns to remove rubbish and garbage and cover water containers. 
- Destruction of mosquito breeding sites by removing standing water, fogging, and applying larvicides. 
- Social mobilization and behaviour change communication. 
- Practice safe sex (applies to pregnant women, their partners, and travellers returning from areas in which Zika is present). 
- Reproductive health counselling and support for couples who plan to have children and who live in areas where Zika is endemic. 

### Vulnerable people

- Any person in the community can get Zika. 
- Zika is a particular concern for pregnant women, women and girls of reproductive age, and couples who want children and who live in area where Zika is endemic. 
- Getting Zika during pregnancy can cause serious brain defects in an unborn baby. 

### If an epidemic occurs

- Increase community-based surveillance. 
- Rapidly detect serious cases and refer them to health facilities.
- Increase social mobilization and behaviour change communication.
- Promote community clean-up campaigns to remove rubbish and cover water containers. 
- Promote prevention of mosquito bites by placing insect screens on windows and doors and wearing personal protection (apply repellents, wear long sleeved clothes, etc.). 
- Give psychosocial support to mothers, families and babies born with brain defects. 
- Eliminate mosquito breeding sites by removing standing water, fogging, and applying larvicides. 
- Encourage young children and people who sleep during the day to sleep under a mosquito net (if windows and doors are not screened). 
- Encourage the practice of safe sex (especially applies to pregnant women, their partners, and travellers who return from areas in which Zika is present).
- If possible, pregnant women should not travel to areas in which Zika is present. 

### Community-based assessment - questions

Make a map of the community and mark the information you gather on the map. Record other details.
- When did people start to fall sick with Zika? 
- How many people have fallen sick with Zika? Where? 
- How many people have been severely ill with Guillain-Barré syndrome? How many have died? Where? 
- Have any children been born with brain or head defects? How many? 
- How many people live in the affected community or area? How many children under 5 years of age live in the area? 
- Who and where are the vulnerable people? 
- How many pregnant women live in the affected communities?
- Do people usually cover their water containers (inside and outside)? 
- How many houses have insect screens on the windows and doors? 
- What are the community’s habits, practices and beliefs regarding use of repellents, sprays, etc.?
- How do people in the community usually dispose of rubbish and solid waste? 
- Have the authorities established a vector control programme?
- Where are the local health facilities and services? (Include traditional and community carers.) 
- What are the community’s habits, practices and beliefs about caring for and feeding sick people? Do women continue to breastfeed babies and infants when they are sick?
-	Is a social mobilization or health promotion programme in place? 
- Which sources of information do people use most? 
- Are rumours or is misinformation about Zika disease spreading in the community?
