- How many people have fallen sick with respiratory infections? Where? 
- How many people have died? Where? 
- How many people live in the affected community or area? How many children under 5 years of age live in the area?
- Who and where are the vulnerable people?
- Are children under 5 most affected? Or are other age groups, occupations, etc., more affected?
- Are children in the affected community generally well nourished? 
-	Do people always have enough food? 
- How common is breastfeeding?
