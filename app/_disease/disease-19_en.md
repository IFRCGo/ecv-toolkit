### Transmission

- Marburg fever first spreads to people from fruit bats.
- It is very infectious and spreads easily from one person to another via blood, faeces, vomit, urine, saliva/spit, sweat, tears, breastmilk or semen from a person sick with Marburg fever that enters the mouth, nose, eyes or a skin cut of another person.
- Can also be spread when handling the body of someone who has died from Marburg fever.
- Via contact with objects (for example, bedding, clothes or needles) that have been contaminated with body fluids from a person who is sick or has died from Marburg fever.
- During unprotected sex with a man who has recovered from Marburg fever.

### Symptoms

- Starts abruptly with fever, severe headache, feeling unwell, muscle pain, nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea.
- Usually followed by a rash and bleeding under the skin and from the nose, vagina, and gums, bloody vomit and stools.
- If severe, can cause confusion, irritability and aggression.
- A very severe and deadly disease that kills around half of the people it infects.
