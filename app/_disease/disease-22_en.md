- Breathing in rodent urine and droppings (faeces) that are stirred up into the air.
- Touching the eyes, nose or mouth after touching rodent droppings, urine, or nests.
- Rodent bite.
- Rarely by close contact with people sick with HPS (for some germs in South America only).

### Symptoms

- Tiredness, fever and muscle aches.
- Coughing and shortness of breath.
- Around 4 out of 10 people with HPS will die.

### Prevention

- Prevent rodents from entering houses or accessing stored food and water (including pet and animal food).
- Follow recommended environmental hygiene practices (for example, dispose of rubbish in rodent-proof containers, minimize possible nesting sites).
- Follow recommended kitchen hygiene practices (for example, clean floors and wash dishes and utensils immediately).
- Introduce social mobilization and behaviour change communication.
- Use personal protective equipment (PPE) and disinfectants when cleaning up rodent droppings and nesting materials.
- Use rodent traps inside and outside homes.
- Properly disinfect and dispose of dead rodents.

### Vulnerable people

- People who come in contact with rodents carrying virus and  their droppings and urine.

### If an epidemic occurs

- Detect people who are sick with HPS quickly and refer them to health facilities.
- Increase social mobilization and behaviour change communication.
- Promote handwashing with soap.
- Prevent rodents from entering houses or accessing stored food and water (including pet or animal food).
- Use rodent traps inside and outside homes.
-	Properly disinfect and dispose of dead rodents.
- Follow recommended environmental hygiene practices. (For example, dispose of rubbish in rodent-proof containers, minimize possible nesting sites).

### Community-based assessment - questions

Make a map of the community and mark the information you gather on the map. Record other details.
- When did people start to fall sick with HPS?
- How many people have fallen sick with HPS? Where?
- How many people have died? Where?
- How many people live in the affected community or area? How many children under 5 years of age live in the area?
- Who and where are the vulnerable people?
- How do people in the community store their food? (Are rats or other rodents able to eat it or contaminate it?)
- How do people in the community dispose of rubbish and solid waste?
- Have the authorities established a vector control programme?
- Do community members have any risky habits or practices when they come into contact with live or dead rodents?
- How do people in the community dispose of dead rats? (For example, are they buried, thrown in the river, burned?)
- Are there handwashing facilities in the community and at health centres? Are soap and water always available?
- Where are the local health facilities and services? (Include traditional and community carers from whom people seek advice.)
-	What are the communityâ€™s habits, practices and beliefs about caring for and feeding sick people? Do women continue to breastfeed babies and infants when they are sick?
- Is a social mobilization or health promotion programme in place?
- Which sources of information do people use most?
- Are rumours or is misinformation about HPS spreading in the community?
