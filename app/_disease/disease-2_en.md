### Transmission

- Contaminated Water. 
- Contaminated food or drink. 
- Dirty hands. 
- Vomit and stools of sick people.

### Symptoms

- Around one in ten people with cholera will be very sick. Most people with cholera only have mild symptoms or are not sick at all but can still transmit the disease. 
- People who have severe cholera will pass large amounts of watery diarrhoea (3 or more loose stools per day, watery like rice water), vomit, and have cramps. They quickly lose a lot of body fluids and they can become dehydrated and go into shock. Without treatment, death can occur within hours. 
- Children with severe cholera may be drowsy or confused, have seizures or become unconscious.

### Prevention

- Safe, clean water (including a clean, covered water container in the household). 
- Use of appropriate sanitation facilities (sound, clean latrines). 
- Handwashing with soap (especially after using the toilet or cleaning a baby).
- Good food hygiene (thoroughly cooked food, covered food, clean utensils, etc.). 
- Exclusive breastfeeding for the first six months of life.
- Social mobilization and behaviour change. 
- Health promotion. 

### Vulnerable people

- Malnourished children. 
- Children under 5. 
- Individuals with chronic medical conditions. 
- Pregnant women. 
- People who do not have easy access to rehydration therapy and health services. 
- People living in areas that have poor water, sanitation and hygiene facilities and services. 

### In case of epidemic

- Initiate community-based surveillance. 
- Treat mild cases in the community by providing oral rehydration solution (ORS). 
- Detect serious cases and refer them to health facilities.
- Increase social mobilization and behaviour change communication.
- Promote household water treatment for safe drinking water (including a clean, covered water container in the household).
- Promote use of appropriate sanitation facilities (sound, clean latrines). 
- Promote good food hygiene (thoroughly cooked food, covered food, clean utensils, etc.).
