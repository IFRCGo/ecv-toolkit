### Germs in water can spread disease. Always use a protected water source â€“ or treat with chemicals, boil or filter to make sure the water you and your family drink will not make you sick.

* There are different types of chemicals that are used to make water safe to drink. People who use chemicals to purify water need to be trained with specific instructions on how to prepare safe water with the chemical they use.
